# Olly App# Olly App - Flutter Weather App with Secure Authentication



A Flutter weather app built for a technical assessment. It features secure user authentication and displays real-time weather information based on your current location.A production-ready Flutter application demonstrating secure user authentication and real-time weather information. Built as a technical assessment showcasing best practices in mobile and web development.



## What It Does[![Flutter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-3.x-02569B?logo=flutter)](https://flutter.dev)

[![Dart](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dart-3.x-0175C2?logo=dart)](https://dart.dev)

This app demonstrates three key requirements: **secure authentication**, **weather display**, and **cross-platform design**. For authentication, I implemented two approaches—a production-ready Supabase backend and a custom local authentication system using SHA-256 password hashing with 10,000 iterations and cryptographic salting. The password hasher includes security features like constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks, and I've backed it up with comprehensive unit tests. Users can register, login, and their sessions persist securely.[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)



The weather feature uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time data based on GPS location. The app automatically detects whether it's day or night using sunrise/sunset times and adjusts the theme accordingly. Users can also search for weather in any city worldwide. I've built this with Flutter's Material Design 3, making it responsive and functional on both web browsers and mobile devices. The codebase follows clean architecture principles with clear separation between authentication, data models, services, and UI components.## � Features



## Running the App### ✅ Authentication System

- **Dual Authentication Options:**

```bash  - **Cloud-Based**: Supabase integration with bcrypt password hashing

# Clone and install dependencies  - **Local Authentication**: Custom SHA-256 implementation with salt (10,000 iterations)

git clone <your-repo-url>- **Secure Password Management**: Industry-standard hashing with constant-time comparison

cd olly_app- **Session Management**: Persistent login with automatic session handling

flutter pub get- **Complete Auth Flow**: Registration, login, logout with validation



# Run on web### 🌤️ Weather Information

flutter run -d chrome- **Real-Time Weather Data**: OpenWeatherMap API integration (v2.5)

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Password Hashing Architecture

The app demonstrates two secure authentication approaches:

#### 1. Supabase Authentication (Active)
- **Server-Side Hashing**: Passwords hashed with bcrypt on Supabase servers
- **HTTPS Transport**: Secure transmission of credentials
- **Built-in Security**: Industry-standard authentication service
- **Session Management**: JWT-based authentication tokens

#### 2. Local Authentication (Demonstration)
Custom implementation showcasing cryptographic knowledge:

```dart
// Password Hashing Process
1. Generate random 256-bit salt
2. Combine password + salt
3. Apply SHA-256 hash 10,000 times (PBKDF2-like)
4. Store: "salt:hashedPassword"

// Password Verification Process
1. Extract salt from stored hash
2. Hash entered password with same salt + iterations
3. Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
```

**Security Features:**
- ✅ **No Plaintext Storage**: Passwords never stored in readable form
- ✅ **Unique Salts**: Each password gets cryptographically random salt
- ✅ **Slow Hashing**: 10,000 iterations slow down brute-force attacks
- ✅ **Timing Attack Prevention**: Constant-time comparison
- ✅ **Industry Standards**: SHA-256 (FIPS 180-4 compliant)
